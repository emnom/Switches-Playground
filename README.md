# Switches-Playground
This is a playground for a math question in Bay Area Mathematical Olympiad 1999.The relevant question:

**A lock has 16 keys arranged in a 4 Ã— 4 array, each key oriented either horizontally or
vertically.   In  order  to  open  it,  all  the  keys  must  be  vertically  oriented.   When  a  key  is
switched to another position, all the other keys in the same row and column automatically
switch their positions too.  Show that no matter what the starting
positions  are,  it  is  always  possible  to  open  this  lock.   (Only  one  key  at  a  time  can  be
switched.)**

This was too difficult to comfortably play with on paper, so I made this.

Note: **This requires Pygame**

To change the dimensions of the box change the table_size variable.
